# Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm

This project is a simple demonstration of how to create a cryptocurrency trading algorithm using Python and Yahoo Finance API. The algorithm uses a moving average crossover strategy to generate buy and sell signals for Bitcoin based on its exchange rate with USD.

## Libraries

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- yfinance: to retrieve historical data of Bitcoin from Yahoo Finance
- pandas: to manipulate and analyze the data
- numpy: to perform numerical calculations
- matplotlib: to plot the data and the trading signals

## How to run

To run the code, simply open the Jupyter notebook file `crypto_trading.ipynb` and execute each cell in order. The code will output the following:

- A plot of the Bitcoin to USD exchange rate for the year 2022
- A plot of the same data with two simple moving averages (9-day and 30-day) added
- A plot of the same data with the buy and sell signals generated by the moving average crossover strategy
- A plot of the value of the portfolio using the crossover strategy compared to a buy and hold strategy
